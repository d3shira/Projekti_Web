    <h2>Experience Kosovo's beauty!</h2>
    <p class="hyrje" style="text-align:center">For a small country such as Kosovo, it has a lot of surface area covered by mountains such as the Sharr Mountains,
        Accursed Mountains (Bjeshkët e Nemuna),  The Albanian Alps, Junik Mountains etc.
        Down below we've included a 2 minute video of some of Kosovos most beautiful mountain views covered in the snow, where you can 
        partake in activities such as hiking or skiing.
        All credits go to the original creator of the video! </p>

            <h4>Skiing in Brezovica</h4>
            <img class="right img-thumbnail" src="images/Activities/skiing.jpg" width="400" height="300">
            <p>Brezovica has intermediate skiing on nice long, mainly treeless, runs. Brezovica is not very large but this is a 
                pretty and popular Winter resort in Kosovo.
                 With skiing covering 2550 hectares of the northern slopes of the lofty Shar Mountain, Brezovica enjoys an excellent 
                 vertical range from November until May. In 1984 it was chosen as an alternative site for the Sarajevo Olympic downhill
                  and the infamous Orlovo Gnezdo is incredibly steep. Brezovica suffered two years of closure during the 98-99 war but 
                  is popular again. There are 4 hotels at Brezovica. Three new lifts opened in 2008. The Velika Livada 2 person chairlift
                   is the newest and fastest one, it is fully functional and it provides access to the Big Valley and the Lions Neck just
                    like Karaula used to, a mid-way stop has been added to this lift recently as a starting point for early May skiing. 
                    The Lavja Vrata 2 person lift is old but still functional, it is one of the first two person chairlifts in the Balkans
                     and it helps you access the Lions Neck. Currently, Brezovica has 3 open pistes, the Lions Neck, Big Valley, and the 
                     Red Rock/Tepsija. There is a lot of space for further development and backcountry skiing. One of the slopes is able to
                      host Giant Slaloms, and all of the slopes are FIS certified.</p>

                 <h4>Skiing in Boga, Rugova</h4>
                    <img class="left map img-thumbnail" src="images/Activities/bogaski.jpg" width="500" height="300" >
                <p>Boga is a small village in the Albanian Alps in western Kosovo. Boga belongs to the municipality of Peja. 
                    There are 3 km of slopes available for skiing and snowboarding. 1 lift transports the guests. 
                    The winter sports area is at an altitude of 1,360 to 1,570 m. Boga is a holiday resort that is only 
                    inhabited by 24 people.
                    The village is located at an altitude of about 1400 m on the southern slopes of the Hajla mountain range 2403 m
                     about 21 kilometers west of Peja. In addition to a winter sports resort, Boga also serves as a starting point
                      for hikes in the area. The Bistrica e Pejës has its source near Boga and continues down the valley to
                       form the Rugova Gorge.
                    Boge is quickly becoming a popular resort in Kosovo. Many holiday homes have been built and the presence 
                    of the ski area attracts many visitors. Boge is the second ski area next to the larger Brezovica in the south
                     of the country. Hiking in Boge Hajla Mountain (2,403m) offers some of the most remote and wildest landscapes. 
                     Picturesque mountain villages are inhabited by farming communities where agricultural practices and traditional 
                     astoral life have been preserved for generations.

            <h2>Hiking</h2>
            <h4>Rugova Canyon</h4>
            <img class="right img-thumbnail" src="images/Activities/rugovahiking.jpg"  width="400" height="300">
            <p>Hiking in the Rugova Valley is just one section of a much wider trail network called Peaks of the Balkans. 
                This massive hiking route stretches out to 192 km in total, taking hikers through the Accursed Mountains of 
                three different countries: Kosovo, Montenegro and Albania. In total, the trek would take at least 10 days to complete, 
                though it's certainly possible to choose certain sections which suit you. Obviously, hiking with your own tent, sleeping
                 bag, and of course, passport, is a must for this hike. It seems to be popular, as during this short day hike,
                  I spotted at least four other trekkers carrying huge loads on their backs. Clearly, they were in for a much longer
                   journey than I was.</p>
                  <h4>Sharr Mountains - Prevalla</h4>
                  <img class="left img-thumbnail" src="images/Activities/sharrhiking.jpg"  width="400" height="300">
                 <p> Oshlak mountain (also called Osljak) is a moderate hike with beautiful views.
                     The ridge of this mountain is very beautiful and it is one of the longest mountain ridges in the Balkans,
                      especially the view of the Sharr mountains range from this mountain is very beautiful.
                      This is a moderate hike starting from Prevalla, which is easy to follow and very well signed.
                       First, you go through a forest, which takes around 1 hour. After this, you go to a meadowy hill
                        which you will quickly climb. Then, you will reach the ridge, and the other part of the trail is
                        a very easy hike, but definitely the most beautiful one. The views from the ridge are very beautiful,
                         and surely you will like them. On the left side, you will see the Sharr Mountains range, in front of you,
                          you will see the city of Prizren and Pashtrik peak, and on the right side, you will see the Black peak and
                           Pashallore peak. The highest peak of this mountain is 2212 m/alt and the total distance is 12 km.</p>
