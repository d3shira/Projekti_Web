    <h4 id="pr" >Why should you visit Prishtina</h4>
    <ul id="lista">
        <li class="li"><mark>Cafe culture</mark>
        </li>
            
        <p>Coffee in Pristina is the best, hands down. Everyone thinks so and even me, who is not so crazy
             about coffee, can vouch for it. With the prices starting at 1€ (and 2-2,5€ for the most expensive
              coffee in the menu) you can be sure Pristina is pure heaven for every coffee lover!The city is full
               of cafes, you can find one every few steps! Some of them are just random places with few tables,
                others are stylish and trendy. You can be sure that you will find
                 something for yourself in Pristina!
                 If you’re wondering why the cafes are busy day and night there’s a second truth to the phenomenon.
                  The unemployment in Kosovo is huge, also among young people. Therefore, instead of sitting at home
                   and feeling miserable people head to the cafe, order one cup for 1€ and spend hours sipping it and 
                   chatting with friends.</p>

        <li class="li"><mark>Laid-back vibe</mark>
        </li>
            <p>Pristina has one of the coolest vibes! Just like the cafes, the main pedestrian street
                  Bulevardi Nënë Tereza  is always full of people walking it up and down.You'd surprised how many
                  people are out there, taking a stroll. Even if the weather was gloomy and it was about to rain 
                  any second people are there.
